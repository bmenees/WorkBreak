# Work Break

This Windows utility tracks continuous working time and suggests periodic breaks.  It’s a tray icon version of the time tracking functionality I used to depend on from my [ClockBandXP](http://www.menees.com/Miscellaneous.htm) plug-in for Windows Explorer.  I stopped using ClockBandXP when Windows 7 included the date in its clock display, but I missed the work time tracking.  Now “Work Break” brings back the old functionality I was used to, and it adds some new bells and whistles.

This software is charityware.  If you like “Work Break” and use it, I ask that you donate something to the charity of your choice.  I'll never know if you follow this policy, but the good karma from following it will be well worth your investment.
